Diabetes is a major health problem inherent to people at all age groups in developing countries. Conventionally, diagnosis of this condition was based on blood sugar level
however, its effect can be traced from other symptoms such as Body Mass Index, and Blood Pressure. This repository introduces a web-based system for diet management. Cases of normal and diabetic users are considered.
