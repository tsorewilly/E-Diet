This research work presents a diet recommendation system for  patients so as to balance the blood sugar level, blood pressure level to the  optimal level and maintain a healthy weight, respectively.<br />
From  the study of existing systems, the following were identified as the specific  motivations for the proposed research work:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The need to incorporate  food allergies and feeding habits of individual patients</li>
        <li>The need to provide  online accessibility to diet recommender system for more availability to more  users.</li>
